## What is Bitcoin

Chances are you're here because you read about `Bitcoin`. So what is Bitcoin?
It's a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash and allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. Bitcoin proposes a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.

### Bitcoin Today

`Satoshi Nakamoto` describes in the [**Bitcoin Whitepaper**](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) written in 2008 that it's a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. Nowadays, it's seen as much more. Bitcoin is accepted as investment vehicle and it's been dubbed `digital gold` by multiple sources. On a daily basis millions of people worldwide use Bitcoin to send and receive payments. Since the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper, (mobile) internet has changed everything the way we work and do business. Traditional finance and the printing of `fiat money` however has only accelerated, a fact that analysts describe as a reason for the success of Bitcoin, reflected by it's price.

Since the inception of Bitcoin, in Â±12 years, the network has stayed online for 99.98% of the time. This blockchain network is the reason for Bitcoin's decentralization and immutability. At the price of $35k in January 2021, it's in the top 10 of the largest assets in the world, by market capitalization.

#### The Bitcoin case

Bitcoin features the following

1. Peer-to-peer payments over an online network. The Blockchain network enabled by millions of computers worldwide `mining` Bitcoin.

2. The elimination of third parties and replacing trust with verification. Verification takes place through the verification of transactions by the blockchain network.

3. Transactions would be irreversible and Nakamoto argues that irreversibility would protect sellers from fraud. Escrow mechanisms can be implemented to protect buyers.

4. A peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server would generate mathematical proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure so long as honest participants collectively control more computing power than attackers/hackers. A hacker would need at least 51% computing power of the entire Blockchain network to `attack` the network. This makes it almost mathematically impossible.

##### Mining and proof of network

Nakamoto says that proof-of-work is used to implement a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp network (mentioned above). The process scans for a value that when hashed, results in a certain numerical expression. The timestamp network must reconcile this value with a block's hash. CPU power is needed to satisfy the proof-of-work, and the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. Later blocks are chained after it, and to change the block would require redoing all the blocks after it.
